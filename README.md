### ClimaLite Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
Welcome to ClimaLite. 

2. Information We Collect
2.1 Location Data

As long as you give permissions, your device's location (latitude and longitude) is captured and is sent to OpenWeather APIs to get forecast at your location and geotimezone API to get time at your location.
You can disable location services in your device settings at any time.
The app allows you to search for any location so even if you disable your device location you should be able to use the app without any issues, it is only that the 
landing page might not show any data

2.2 Technical Information

- Query geotimezone API for getting time at your location
- load Google Maps and option to locate your current location

3. How We Use Your Information

- Provide weather forecasts at your current location (if permission allowed) along with other locations that you search for
- We neither store your device location / timezone or any of your search history, however the above external services may capture the queried data which we don't have control of.
- Last 10 searched locations are captured and showed as an option but they are stored on your device and not on any network, meaning you have full control on this list and delete them as needed

4. Data Protection

Location data is anonymized and not linked to personal identifiers
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties

5. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party weather data providers
These providers may use your device IPs or any information that you are using to query the app, we don't have control over
